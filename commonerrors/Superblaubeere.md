## Superblaubeere27's Obfuscator
One issue with this obfuscator is that it may inject local variables into the code, which prevents the file from being completely deobfuscated. In that case, use general.LocalVariableRemover, write to file, and then run the deobfuscator on the output. If you are still having issues with some features not being deobfuscated, use DeadCodeRemover and then RedundantGotoRemover to get rid of the junk code that may be in the way.
